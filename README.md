# Casual-Quora
Blocks the login prompt that appears when browsing Quora without having signed in.

## Description
Casual Quora is a very simple plugin that prevents Quora from prompting you to login when you click on another Quora article. It adds a paramter to requests your browser makes to Quora, which tells Quora not to send the login prompt.

## Installation
Currently, Causual Quora can only be installed in Firefox desktop and Fireforx for Android. You can install Causual Quora via [Firefox Browser Add-Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/casual-quora/).

## Usage
Once you have Casual Quora installed, there is nothing you need to do. Casual Quora will do all its necessary work silently in the background.
